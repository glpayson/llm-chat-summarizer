Create a summary that:

1. Preserves the emotional journey and how feelings evolved
2. Captures key insights, decisions, and questions explored
3. Maintains important factual details and timeline updates
4. Tracks how perspectives and priorities shift over time
5. Notes significant developments in relationships or situations mentioned
6. Includes 2-3 direct quotes that capture the person's voice or crucial moments
7. Preserves any action items, plans, or decisions made

Write the summary as a flowing narrative that maintains both practical details and emotional nuance. Aim for 1300 words. Focus on continuity - how thoughts and situations build on previous ones.
